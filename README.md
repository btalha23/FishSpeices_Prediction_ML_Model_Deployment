# FishSpeices_Prediction_ML_Model_Deployment
Repo for deploying an ML model for predicting species of fish

Prediction of fish species is a classification problem. Here it is solved by exploiting the Gradient Boosting Classifier model.

Gradient Boosting Classifier model implemented in the python library scikit-learn is the basis of the inference performed in the web app.
